//
		
	1.	First, rename the mel script, ff_bTweaks_TEMP.mel, to your character.
			
		     i.e. ff_bTweaks_TEMP.mel becomes ff_bTweaks_moomoo.mel
		
		
	2.	You MUST do a search & replace inside the ff_bTweaks_TEMP.mel script 
		for the following objects. Search for these, and append a suffix of _moomoo
		(or whatever you want your character suffix to be) to the name. The number 
		represents how many of that object exists in the script.

		     i.e. ff_bTweaks becomes ff_bTweaks_moomoo
		
		     (3) ff_bTweaks
		     (8) btWin
		     (2) bTweakSetup
	 	     (4) bTweak_blends
		     (3) GRP_bTweak_xtras
		     (4) GRP_bTweak_JS
		     (2) bTweak1
			
			****IMPORTANT***
			rename the last one, but keep the 1 last...i.e
			bTweak_cHead1 
			           or
			bTweak_cHead_1

			***NOT***
			bTweak1_cHead
		

	3.	The following needs to be renamed to your specific rig/mesh. The
		first one depends on what you namespace your reference file.
		
		     (3) dillo1:fullBody_geo
		     (3) fullBody_geo


	4.	Open your master rig file, and import bTweak_setup.ma into your file.
		*make sure namespaces are turned OFF*

		- Parent GRP_bTweak_setup under your main character node.
		
		- Position PLC_bTweak_home roughly around your JS facial setup
		
		- You can then move GRP_bTweak_go to your liking
		
		- Position JS_camPiv_L & _R around the outer edges of your JS setup
		    (they're the pink cubes...must be selected in the hypergraph/outliner)
		
		- Once you're finished, go to your hypershade and make the camPivots_cm
		   fully transparent so they're hidden. 
			
			** Don't just hide the geo, they need to be 
			    "visible in your scene", but just transparent **

		- Test it out by clicking on the hands. Make sure triggers are on.
	
		- Save your file. Be sure to make a backup first!

		- In your scene files, you need to update triggers for the hands to work.
			Advanced > Update All Triggers

		
	5.	By default, the camera transition in your settings are super slow.
		I like them off completely, and you can do that by going to 
		
		Window > Settings/Preferences > Preferences
		Settings > Cameras

		and uncheck all the boxes under "Animate Camera Transitions"

		If you like some transition, 0.2 for the Total time isn't too bad.


	6.	Don't forget to add this to your shelf:

		source ff_bTweaks_char;
		ff_bTweaks_char;

		(rename _char to your character's suffix)


	7. 	enjoy the little things....doubletap!

		be happy =)
